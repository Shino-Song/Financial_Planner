Notice - Finally decided to start a changelog. This will play a role similar to traditional changelogs, but also serve as a form of active journal of problems I'm encountering and what I am learning. As pushes as not just when I fix things since I also push when I make progress and want to swap computers, I will use this to better document the problems I am having at pushes. Obviously I acknowledge pushes should be when things are fixed or working features are added, but that isn't the full purpose of this project. My push focus will adjust more appropriately once I have the core program fully functioning to where there is a benefit of having two branches (working and journaling). But for now, this is what it is!

V 0.0.1 - Worked on the report feature a bit. I added a return instruction to a function of the budget class in budget_processing to expose the relevant data. However, it is having an issue where it needs a "self" variable, and I need to look into why that is and it isn't just reading the data relavant. Probably something obvious and I'm just brain farting.
