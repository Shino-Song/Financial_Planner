# Notes for planning -
# take income data and store for processing
# ask questions about current tax rules
# (maybe?) create database with yearly tax rules (do I really want to go that far?)
# (if^) intelegently apply appropriate tax rules and ask for verification of selected rules to be applied.
# Return processed data.
