# Financial_Planner
Open source financial planning software

# Introduction

Hello! To give the simplest introduction, this is a personal project that I am making for the purpose of using myself. The goal is to build a financial planner that can track financial data dynamically, give simple and detailed overviews, intelegently manage budgets and goals, and intelegently ingest bank/credit card documentation then sort the information to its appropriate destination.

This is also my first major project I am starting for the prupose of practical use. There is definitely a lot I will be learning and as such, the state of the project will likely change dramatically over time. I do not plan to feature creep the project unless it is a feature that is necessary to make other aspects work. Any new non-critical features will be made low priority until existing planned features are in an acceptable state. Followers of the project are welcome to leave suggestions and for their own branch for development given you provide appropriate attribution of the original development.

# General expectations of use (to be replaced by license eventually)

At this time (and this will be edited out when no longer applicable), there is no set license. I am looking at the options for what is most appropriate for my goals in this project. So until then, understand that this project is inherently intended to be free and open source. My intent is for this to be usable freely to all parties and to allow further independant developement if one so desires. All instances that are based off my source should give credit to this, the original. For the purposes of monetary gain and such, this software can be used in services that generate revenue, presuming it is credited appropriately and noted that the functionality or lack there of is not my responsibility. Any losses incurred financially, professionally, and socially cannot be attributed to the original author. I may release some forms of this project for a "fee", eg. a steam software version for voluntary funding of the development, but that will not change the fact that every aspect of my development here will be made freely avaliable.

# Features/to-do

# Closing statement

As I have mentiond, this is more of a project for myself and what I would like to have for my own uses. It is something I would find useful to enrich my own life and be useful as a project to better learn programming. I can foresee many concerns and roadblocks along the way, from maintaining privacy to ramming my head against a wall on how to implement a feature. I am also by no means an artist of any kind, so making the front end visually appealing is something I will be working on and likely outsource if I find support for the project. This project is not to fill a niche or cause an upset in the market, in fact, I haven't even looked at what professional offerings there are! This is not intended to be used for any critical or high stakes environments, especially in ways that are mission critical as if there is a problem with the software, I make no guarantees to anything, let alone any claim of quality. I am also not without my own self interest, while I have promised and will continue to promise that the software is open and free, I will likely give options to help support and encourage my project through monetary means (the sooner I have my annoying student debts eleminated, the happier this dev will be!). Any and all forms of support will strictly be voluntary and have no impact on feature priorities or timeline estimates unless you want to throw me lifechanging amounts of support. For 4 or more figures, I will happily prioritize a feature or fix, but no amount of money will change the fact this will be forever an open and free project. With that, specialized features should be done through forks with the purpose of inhouse development. As my priority is the public Open Source version, I cannot guarantee any extra specialized features. IF you wish to hire my services to develop said features professionally, that may become an option in the future once core features are more polished.

I hope you who have stumbled upon this project and read this far have taken interest in the ramblings of this madman and enjoy following the progress of whatever adventure this project becomes! Who knows, maybe I'll even start streaming it at some point ㅋㅋㅋ

Signing off,
Shino
