This is an Obsidian project. It is a collection of documents, photos, code, and other relevant files to better visualize and keep track of the project as a whole. The primary feature of this format is the canvas, where one can visualize the interaction of each file in the project.

Documents will be made to represent each file in the project. These documents will detail how each file is intended to work and interact with each other. The beginning of each file related document will start with an overview of its purpose and general function. The middle will reflect the active code, detailing how it works and why. The ending will show change history and thoughts for future improvements and changes. This is not meant to be brief or storage conscious. It will not be included in any form of "shipped" code, as it is for education of the reader and to assist me in improving my skill in programming. One can expect to see ramblings and trains of thought here. Another key purpose of this is to minimize use of comments in the actual code itself, as this documentation will serve as the commenting for the code.
