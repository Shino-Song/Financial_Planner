Deductions are any variables that make the income lower than the whole amount. These include taxes, insurance, etc... It it touches the paycheck before it hits your bank account, it is a deduction. As not all deductions are applied to income before it hits the bank account, there will be an option to customize deductions so one can put aside funds as necessary. This can also be used to estimate future income deductions for actual and simulated incomes.
