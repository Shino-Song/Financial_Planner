1: Actual balance (H) - This is a field that displays your actual balance and is manually inputted.

2: Calculated balance (H) - This is a field that takes the actual balance of the previous month and the math of income and expenses to display what the actual balance should be.

3: Actual/Calculated balance agreement indication (H) - States if the Actual and Calculated balances are in agreement or disagreement to indicate if there is a clerical error in the data entry.

4: Total estimated/actual income (H) - Fields that take projected and actual gross/net income reports to show what you can expect to have in an requested time period. Can take multiple sources of income fields to keep track of different income sources.

5: Total estimated/actual income agreement indication (H) - This compares the total actual and estimated incomes and individual income sources to determine trends of what you estimated and actually received.

6: Deductions estimation (H) - a preset calculation to run various dedications from the Total estimated/actual income entries (eg. taxes, insurance, etc...). This should be items that are taken out of the Gross income before it hits your bank account or an amount that should be set aside if items are not automatically deducted.

7: Categorized expenses (H) - Separate customizable sections of expense types (eg. utilities, food, phone/internet/, fun, etc...). This is further broken down into individual expenses that can be projected, manually added, or automatically pulled from bank/credit card statements and organized locally (never sent off of your computer).

10: Bank integration (L) - A tool that can integrate with your bank/credit card to automatically pull data and update the relevant fields at set intervals (will never send data out to other places. Low priority until I know how to ensure the highest level privacy).
