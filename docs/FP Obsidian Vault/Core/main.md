Intro -

Main is the start of everything and the front facing file that will serve as the relay of information from the user to the rest of the software. Main's goal is to ask relevant questions, send information where it needs to initially go, allow the user to access various information, fetch said information, and be clear and concise in its user-facing language.

Main is primarily designed to be used in CLI. Future iterations with a GUI are planned, but are secondary in priority. GUI iterations will be considered once the core logic is feature complete and the CLI front-end is polished.
